# Disconnected OpenShift cluster installation guide

This guide explains how to deploy an OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) in a disconnected environment. It utilizes a bastion server for secure communication and a private Quay repository hosted on a mirror server to manage container images.

## Overview

### Components Overview

- **Quay Repository**: A private repository that manages and stores your container images.
- **Bastion Server**: A server that facilitates secure interaction between your local network and the disconnected OCP environment.
- **Mirror Server**: Hosts the Quay repository and is part of the infrastructure that mirrors external resources needed for OpenShift installation.
- **VPC Setup**: Both the bastion and the mirror servers are located within the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), ensuring they can communicate securely.
- **External Access**: Both the bastion and the mirror servers are accessible thru ssh.

### Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to set up your disconnected OpenShift Cluster:

1. **Set Up the bastion and the mirror Server**:
   - The bastion server functions as a secure gateway linking your local network to the OpenShift cluster. 
   - The mirror server hosts the Quay repository and mirrors essential resources, providing them to the OpenShift environment.

2. **Set Up the Quay Repository**:
   - Configure the private Quay repository on the mirror server to manage OpenShift images.Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/opdev/disconnectedOCPdemo/blob/main/doc/quay-registry-installation.md).

3. **Install OpenShift**:
   - From the bastion server, install the OpenShift Container Platform using the resources available from your mirror server.Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/opdev/disconnectedOCPdemo/blob/main/doc/disconnectedOCP-installation.md).

4. **Install Operators**:
   - Install OpenShift operators using the images managed in your Quay repository.Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/rocrisp/dell).

## Conclusion

Each component plays a critical role in establishing a robust and secure OCP environment in disconnected setups. Proper configuration and integration of these components are essential for a successful deployment.

**Note:** 

The `oc-mirror-workspace` directory includes files generated by `oc-mirror`.

- `config/imageSetConfig.yaml`: This file is used for configuring `oc mirror`.
- `config/install-config.yaml`: This file is used for configuring `openshift-install`.
